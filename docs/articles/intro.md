#### UI

The UI package is a base library for building out great user experiences for applications built for Windows, Android, iOS, and the web.

Taking advantage of the Uno Platform, the UI packages provide extensible features such as:

- Control, a base implementation on top of the XAML `Control` type with additional functionality such as `IsVisible` (to get and set the state of the control's visibility), and `GetChildView` (to find and retrieve a UI element which is a child of the element).
- ContentControl, a base implementation on top of the XAML `ContentControl` type with additional functionality such as `IsVisible` (to get and set the state of the control's visibility), and `GetChildView` (to find and retrieve a UI element which is a child of the element).
- ViewExtensions, a collection of extensions for manipulating XAML `UIElement` objects including `SetVisible` (to toggle the visible state of the element and child elements).
